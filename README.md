# Sampling-Theory Studio

### Description:
-  It is a Desktop application that illustrates the signal sampling and recovery showing the importance and validation of the Nyquist Theory

### Our Features:
   * Visualize and sample an uploaded signal and use the sampled points to recover the original signal
   * Adding noise to the loaded signal and reconstructing it. 
   * Prepare mixed signal by adding sinusoidal signals with different frequancy and magnitudes. 
   * Sampling and reconstructing the mixed signal.
   * Adding noise to the mixed signal and reconstructing it.
   * Remove any component from the mixed signal.
   * Downloading the reconstructed signal.
   * Resize the signals without missing the UI.

### Technology used:
