# Sampling-Theory Studio

### Description:
-  It is a Desktop application that illustrates the signal sampling and recovery showing the importance and validation of the Nyquist Theory

### Our Features:
   * Sampling an uploaded Signal and Visualize its reconstruction.
   * Adding SNR noise to the loaded signal and reconstructing it. 
   * Prepare Mixed signal by adding sinusoidal signals with different frequancies and amplitudes. 
   * Sampling and reconstructing the mixed signal.
   * Adding noise to the mixed signal and reconstructing it.
   * Remove any component from the mixed signal.

### Technology used:
- PyQt5 and PyQtGraph
